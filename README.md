# Tutorial-01-MembersList

Created with CodeSandbox

Teaching Peter how to build websites with React. So far we have;

-   Had a mini-primer on HTML, CSS and then React & JS
-   Gone more in-depth with JS
-   Created a simple members list using data copied from an API response
-   Styled components
-   Learnt about iterating over arrays with map
-   Used the web inspector to view styles used on other sites
-   Discussed and implemented CSS features such as Grid and Flex

I have created this repo so we can commit to it after each session to potentially help others get into webdev.
