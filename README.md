# Tutorial-01-MembersList
Created with CodeSandbox

Teaching Peter how to build websites with React. So far we have;

 - Had a mini-primer on HTML, CSS and then React & JS
 - Gone more in-depth with JS
 - Created a simple members list using data copied from an API response
 - Styled components
 - Learnt about iterating over arrays with map
 - Used the web inspector to view styles used on other sites
 - Discussed and implemented CSS features such as Grid and Flex

I have created this repo so we can commit to it after each session to potentially help others get into webdev.
